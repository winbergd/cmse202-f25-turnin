The dataset includes all block groups in California from the 1990 Census. On average, each block group contains approximately 1,425.5 individuals residing in a geographically compact area. As expected, the size of each area varies inversely with population density. Distances between block group centroids are calculated using latitude and longitude coordinates. Block groups with zero values for either the independent or dependent variables were excluded from the analysis. The final dataset consists of 20,640 observations across 9 variables.\n",
